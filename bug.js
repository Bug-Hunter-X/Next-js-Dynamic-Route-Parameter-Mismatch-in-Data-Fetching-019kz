In Next.js, a relatively uncommon error arises when using dynamic routes with data fetching methods like `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`.  The issue stems from inconsistencies between the route parameters defined in `pages/[...slug].js` (or similar) and the actual data fetched.  For example, if your route expects parameters like `/product/shirt/red` but your data fetching function only handles `/product/shirt`, parts of the URL will not be properly utilized, leading to unexpected behavior or errors. This often manifests as missing data or incorrect rendering.
